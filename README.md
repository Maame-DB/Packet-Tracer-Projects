CASE STUDY: Cisco Packet Tracer Project: Network Design for Accounts and Delivery Departments
This project involves designing a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect the Accounts and Delivery departments. The network is designed to meet the following specifications and requirements.

Project Requirements
1. Department Setup:
Each department (Accounts and Delivery) must contain at least two PCs.

2. Network Devices:
Use an appropriate number of switches and routers to establish the network.

3. IP Addressing:
Configure the network using the given address block: 192.168.40.0.

All interfaces must be assigned appropriate:
IP addresses
Subnet masks
Gateways

4. Connections:
Ensure that all devices in the network are connected using appropriate cables.

5. Connectivity Testing:
Test the network to verify connectivity between the two departments:
PCs in the Delivery department should be able to ping the PCs in the Accounts department.

Features
Logical subdivision of the network into two departments.
IP address configuration for all devices.
Verification of connectivity through Ping tests.

How to Use
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Inspect the network topology to confirm all devices are connected.
Use the simulation mode to test connectivity by pinging devices in the opposite department.
